      <p>
        I’m a beginner web developer learning how to build clean, simple websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy breaking problems into small steps and understanding how different pieces of a webpage connect together. Through my projects, I’ve practiced creating multi-page layouts, styling with CSS, and writing basic JavaScript to add functionality. As I continue learning, I’m especially interested in moving toward UX/UI design, where I can focus on how users experience and interact with websites. My goal is to build sites that are not only functional, but also intuitive, readable, and thoughtfully designed for real people.
